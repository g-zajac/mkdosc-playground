# Charging System with Drone Port

To integrate charging system with a droneport, standard system (just a plate without box) is needed with additional interface cable, which allows bi-directional communication.

Prcedure

- order addtional components for building the cable.
- cut dsub cable in half, strip wires, add heat shrink tube
- solder wires to header according the table, [specification](assets/dp-signals.pdf)
- optionally, activate [SDK](sdk-auth.md) to remote access and test at CDM

## Additional components
Components required for building the cable interface (Mouser codes):

* Cable D-Sub kabel DB15M/F  CS-DSDMDB15MF-005 For droneport interface only female is neded (charger side)[^1].
* Header for source board (2x22, 44pins): 7-534206-2 header & wire housing 2x22p

## The interface
Charging System is connected with a Droneport with a cable. One end has D-SUB15, other 44 header pin socket.

<!-- *D-Sub15 female connector - to the Droneport* -->
the D-SUB 15 ==female== plug goes to Droneport controller.

<!-- *socket - to pinheader located next to BB on the source board* -->
the 44pin socket goes to pin header located next to BB on the source PCB.

## Add drone port config to the config file
To enable Drone Port interface the GPIO section needs to be added to the skycharge config file.
Login remotly to a charging system with ssh and edit the file:
```bash
nano /etc/skycharge.conf
```

on the bottom add lines:

```bash
#
# DronePort configuration
#

dp-hw-interface          = gpio
dp-is-closed-pin         = P8.07  # gpio66
dp-in-progress-pin       = P8.08  # gpio67
dp-is-drone-detected-pin = P8.09  # gpio69
dp-is-opened-pin         = P8.10  # gpio68
dp-open-pin              = P8.11  # gpio45
dp-close-pin             = P8.12  # gpio44
dp-is-landing-err-pin    = P8.13  # gpio23
dp-is-ready-pin          = P8.14  # gpio26
```

Detailed description of the config can be found [here](https://support.skycharge.de/docs/configuration-file). 

Restart the skycharge deamon:
```bash
systemctl restart skycharged
```

To test the droneport config run:
```bash
skycharge-cli show-droneport-state
```
