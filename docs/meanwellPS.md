The Meanwell (RSP-1600-48) [documentation](https://www.meanwell-web.com/content/files/pdfs/productPdfs/MW/RSP-1600/RSP-1600-spec.pdf) states :
VOLTAGE ADJ. RANGE: 47.5 ~ 58.8V - this is in default settings with regulation with a pot. 
In our case, the source board controls the PS and we should look at:
OUTPUT VOLTAGE PROGRAMMABLE(PV) - Adjustment of output voltage is allowable to 40 ~ 125% of nominal output voltage (60 ~ 125% for 12V).

so 40% from nominal voltage 48V is: 19,2V
125% - 60V

in summary the RSP-1600-48 we are using can deliver from 19,2V up to 60V and up to 33A
